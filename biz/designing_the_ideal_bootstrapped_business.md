YouTube video "Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business with Jason Cohen"

# Make Sure There's a Market
- get 20 or 30 people to give you a check for something that doesn't exist yet
  - because it solves a pain they have

If you can't scrape together 75-150 customers over some months, it's never going to be a business. 
LinkedIn direct reachouts, AdWords...

# Pricing/Value
It must be valuable, so $70+/mo. on average.

Use pricing tiers or a high price with coupon codes.
Give bloggers coupon codes.

If you're one person ("boutique"), don't hide it.

Annual prepaid: essential. Take the money and re-invest:

- better design
- development
- advertising

There's a lot about pricing here, but the main point is that perception of savings is powerful: coupon codes, discounts for annual subscriptions. Also, price elasticity is lower than you expect. "Raise the damn prices." Double, then double again until sales go down.

ARPU - average revenue per user

Tiers
- 3-4 tiers
- a crazy big one, 'business tier'

No free trials: money-back guarantee instead.

# Type of Business

B2B ONLY.
Only recurring revenue, so no "sell to brides" or "services for event organizers"
  - continuous pain
  - continuous value

A tool to handle ever-changing conditions, like SEO.

Not real-time/time-sensitive.
